MarkdownService
===============

The MarkdownService allows to convert a Markdown text into an HTML Github Markdown using the OS X services context menu.
The main idea is to have a kind of extension of [Markdown Here](http://markdown-here.com/) for Apple Mail.

## Usage

Start by writing your text in `Markdown`.

Select the text that needs to be converted, right click and finally select `Services -> Markdown to GitHub HTML`.

## Install

* Copy `MarkdownService.service` inside the `~/Library/Services` directory.

## Improvements

* Using Github Flavored Markdown
